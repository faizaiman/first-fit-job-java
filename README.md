The operating system is also refereed as the resource manager which allocates the different resources to the processes. One of such processes is the operating system memory which is allocated based on the demand of the processes.  The operating system uses different schemes for this purpose, the most common among them are, first fit, best fit, and worst fit.

The first fit memory allocation scheme is a technique through which the operating system allocates memory to the processes based on the memory demands. In this method, the operating system allocates the first memory slot it finds empty to a process in demand. This memory allocation is not considered as a good technique as it allocates huge empty memory spaces even to small process which results in massive memory wastages.
